# Patient-Experience-Dashboard-Visualization
I created 2 Data Visualization Dashboards with Power BI for my Data Visualization class using a pre-cleaned dataset of patient experience surveys from a medical practice. With Power BI, I built two interactive dashboards to identify patterns in patient satisfaction of the office and compare analytics for each appointment type.
